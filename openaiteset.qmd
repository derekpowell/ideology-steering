all_statement_prompts_CSE <- list()

for (level in names(CSE_levels)) {
  prompt <- paste0(
    "Please generate answers in the following task based on the information provided below. ",
    "You should take into account of the statements as well as your level of agreement toward them.\n\n",
    paste(CSE_items[[level]], collapse = "\n\n")
  )
  
  all_statement_prompts_CSE[[level]] <- prompt
}
```


## creating user prompts

## setting prompts
```{r}
# chat_messages <- list(

#   messages = chat_messages,
#   openai_api_key = OPENAI_KEY,
#   max_tokens = 5
# )
```

## testing a completion

```{r}
# print(chatresult$choices$message.content)
```

```{r}
# process_response <- function(response){
#     response$choices$message.content
# }
# 
# cat(process_response(chatresult))
